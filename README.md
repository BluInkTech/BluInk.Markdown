# Bookmark

Bookmark is a plain text format for writing structured documents. It can also be used for blogs, notes and other form of prose.

It takes inspiration from Markdown but differs substantially in a lot of areas. Markdown is good for writing prose as it is simple to learn but, it has limitations which makes it difficult to use for large technical work.

HTML is used as the common output format of HTML. There are a number of features in Markdown which maps directly to HTML. This can be limiting when the output format is not HTML. In case of writing a technical manual or a book, the Markdown format lacks the expressive aspect required to define features needed for a complex writing task. For example: Page notes, side notes, cross references etc.

Bookmark is designed to utilize HTML, Latex along with the variants, e-Pub etc. as the output format.
